This repository contains my senior project from the Computer Science department at San Francisco State University. 
It is a alert notification web app, similar to citizen or amber alert, where California residents can register their location information and contact information and recieve alerts from their county directors.
Notifications vary from weather alerts, health/covid alerts, security alerts, and wild fire alerts.
I was a full stack developer on this project responsible for writing much of the front-end and back-end code in addition to contributions with the MySQL database.
